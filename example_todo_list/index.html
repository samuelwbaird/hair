	// this simple example broken into a model class and view functions
	// in this example code the view is "aware" of the model, reads data from it and calls methods to update data or mutate the model
	// but the model is not "aware" of the view, it has no direct references to the view
	// the model "signals" to hair.js whenever model objects have been updated, to trigger re-render of watching components
	import TodoModel from './js/model.js';
	import app from './js/view.js';
	
	// create the data model for the app
	const model = new TodoModel('Important TODO list');
	model.addItem('Eat beans');
	model.addItem('Drink coffee');
	
	// stress test with a long list
	// for (let i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
	// 	model.addItem('Stress Test Item ' + i);
	// }
	
	// -- render the app in place ---------------------------------
	const parent = document.getElementById('app');
	const context = hair.render(parent, model, app);
	
	// the app relies on the simple global watch/signal mechanism to re-render updates to the model
	// from this point the view will be re-rendered if the state objects signal they have changed (eg. through model update methods)
	
	// we can also use the context object to update view for other reasons
	// this is an artifical example using a timer (hair's shared central timer) to pretend new data has come in from the network
	hair.delay(10, () => {
		model.addItem('Automated reminder: feed the cat');
	});
	
	// other updates could be requested directly using the context object that as created
	// onNetworkState = () => { context.update(model); };
	// onFrame = () => { context.update(model); };

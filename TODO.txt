PIXI
remove UpdateList, or move it to core
move context to core, and make it the base class of html render context
update names in hair.html to be more specific, eg. HTMLRenderContext
de-emphasise PixiNode, make it internal only? 
can it be melted with context or even one or other removed
remove subclasses as a method of building scenes
just a begin method...
addDisposable to the hair render context? (base class context)
 
 
h.onBroadcast... how to target ID'd elements within the pixi view, ID to context from the create method!
context knows about its parent
nodes know about their children

context gets children references set by ID (both hair HTML and pixi view objects)

how to do fixed updates (eg. physics timers)
or animation... each animated clip requests its own core.timer?
both animation and fixed update, how to align time against render time...
eg. delta or delta (aligned to X fps)

fixed update should be propagated by node tree, or just leave that be and rely on phase only??

"walk" the views and update animation
"walk" the nodes and do fixed update
or add a fixed update as a component...
like adding an animation timer?

	// this simple example broken into a model class and view functions
	// in this example code the view is "aware" of the model, reads data from it and calls methods to update data or mutate the model
	// but the model is not "aware" of the view, it has no direct references to the view
	// the model "signals" to hair.js whenever model objects have been updated, to trigger re-render of watching components
	import TodoModel from './js/model.js';
	import app from './js/view.js';
	
	// create the data model for the app
	const model = new TodoModel('Important TODO list');
	model.addItem('Eat beans');
	model.addItem('Drink coffee');
	
	// -- render the app in place ---------------------------------
	const parent = document.getElementById('app');
	const context = hair.render(parent, model, app);
	
	
	
	// -- additional artificial example code to exercise the app -------------
	
	// the app relies on the simple global watch/signal mechanism to re-render updates to the model
	// we can also trigger updates to the model outside of user interaction
	// for example, this timer pretending we're getting updates from the network
	let count = 0;
	setInterval(() => {
		// model.addItem('New item from the network ' + (++count));
	}, 15 * 1000);
	
	// we can use hair's central timer (which runs requestAnimationFrame only around due times on demand)
	const UI_FEEDBACK_PHASE = 5;
	hair.delay(5, () => {
		console.log('delayed action, include in requested phase at the appropriate frame');
	}, UI_FEEDBACK_PHASE, model);
	
	// other updates could be requested directly using the context object that as created
	// onNetworkState = () => { context.update(model); };
	// onFrame = () => { context.update(model); };
